Hi! I’m **omu**(aka bk), a self-claimed full-stack engineer with a strong focus on Rust, C/C++, and Python.

I’m deeply passionate about **computer graphics** and love crafting stunning visual effects using GLSL. Currently, I’m working on building an ECS-based game engine using Rust and WGSL, combining my interests in graphics and systems programming.

One of my biggest hobbies is **game development**. Over the years, I’ve experimented with tools like GM8, GMS2, Unity, and now Godot. In fact, I was one of the earliest developers of FNAF fan games.

I’m also a **music producer**! I’ve been creating music of many different genres since 2018. Tapping into my production skills, I became a OTOMADer before I realized it. In early 2024, I began my career as a Vocaloid-P.

My fav albums are **834.194** and **野口、久津川で爆死**, respectively by Sakanaction and Mowmowlulugyaban. They are my favorite bands as well.
